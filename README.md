# Implementation of Ricart-Agrawala

## Description

You are required to implement distributed mutual exclusion among nodes in a distributed system. Your implementation must use the Ricart-Agrawala algorithm discussed during the lectures.

## System Requirements

**R1 (Spec):** Implement a system with a set of nodes and a Critical Section that represents a sensitive system operation. Any node may request access to the Critical Section at any time. In this exercise, the Critical Section can be emulated, for example, by a print statement or writing to a shared database on the network

**R2 (Safety):** Only one node may enter the Critical Section at any time

**R3 (Liveliness):** Every node that requests access to the Critical Section will eventually gain access

## Technical Requirements

- Implement the service's nodes using Golang
- Provide a README.md file in your source code repository that explains how to start your system
- Use gRPC for message passing between nodes (hint: each node is both a grpc server and a client to every other node)
- Demonstrate that the system can start with at least three nodes
- Show, using system logs, a sequence of messages that leads to a node gaining access to the Critical Section.

**Note.** Implement some sort of service discovery so that nodes can locate each other. Options to consider include:
- hardcoding in each node (easy)
- Supplying a file with IP addresses and ports of other nodes
- Entering IP addresses and ports via the command line
- Using an existing package or service for discovery

## Hand-in Requirements

- Submit a single report as a PDF file (maximum 2 pages)
- Describe how your system meets the System Requirements (R1, R2, and R3)
- Provide a discussion of your algorithm, using examples from your logs (as per Technical Requirement 5)
- Include a link to a Git repository with your source code in the report
- Append system logs in the report's appendix to demonstrate that the requirements are met
